# Note-Taker
<br>
<h1>Description</h1>
<br>
The purpose of this application was to be able to write, save and delete notes. This application used express for the backend in order to minipulate data from a JSON file.

This application already had the frontend built out and was to show my backend devloper skills to build out a functional working application using express.
